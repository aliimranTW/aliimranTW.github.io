Hello! I am Ali, and I work on making robots that can safely and reliably operate in spaces shared with people. My research sits at the intersection of human-centric robotics, multi-robot systems and swarm intelligence.

I am currently a PhD candidate at <a href='https://initrobots.ca'>Lab INIT Robots</a>, supervised by Professor <a href='https://initrobots.ca/en/team/david-st-onge'>David St-Onge</a>, with Professor <a href='https://mila.quebec/en/directory/giovanni-beltrame'>Giovanni Beltrame</a> as my co-supervisor. Before this, I completed my Master’s in Robotics at the University of Bristol, where I had the opportunity to work on swarm robotics with the <a href='https://hauertlab.com/'>Hauert Lab</a>. I earned my Bachelor’s in Electronic Engineering from Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute <a href='https://giki.edu.pk/'>(GIKI)</a> of Engineering Sciences and Technology in Pakistan.

<!-- My technical experience ranges from developing AI algorithms and optimizing them for deployment on embedded hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson), to robot hardware development and rapid prototyping. I also enjoy teaching and mentoring, and I’ve had the chance to teach robotics to undergraduate students and supervise master’s students. -->

<!-- Broadly, my work focuses on human-centric robotics in shared environments. I use decentralized robot teams for collaborative perception—moving from spatio-temporal human intent prediction to joint human–robot state estimation for decentralized human motion modeling and navigation. By combining multimodal sensing with decentralized learning, I aim to build richer scene understanding and enable robust, safety-aware coordination, validated on real multi-robot systems. -->

<p class="swarm-hint">Move your mouse around to play with the swarm. Watch them flock using simple swarming rules like attraction and repulsion. :)</p>
