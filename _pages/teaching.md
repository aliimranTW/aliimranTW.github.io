## Teaching Assistant — Robotics Course
<div class="row align-items-center">
<div class="col-md-7">
<p>
Since 2023, I have been contributing as a Teaching Assistant for a robotics course, where my responsibilities extend beyond traditional classroom support. I help maintain and upgrade the fleet of mobile robots, ensuring reliable hardware performance for student experiments.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Key Contributions:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ROS2 Migration:</strong> Worked on migrating the robot fleet from ROS1 to ROS2, implementing updated communication frameworks and improving system reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Sensor Integration:</strong> Integrated and configured sensors including <em>Ultra-Wideband (UWB)</em> beacons and <em>Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO)</em> systems for the teaching lab setup.</li>
<li><strong>Localization Stack:</strong> Worked towards the developement of the localization codebase used in student experiments, including sensor fusion with <em>Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Testing & Validation:</strong> Conducted extensive testing and validation of robot systems to ensure consistent performance across the fleet.</li>
<li><strong>Student Support:</strong> Provide hands-on debugging assistance, helping students troubleshoot hardware issues, sensor calibration, and software integration challenges.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I have had the opportunity to contribute to the supervision of Master's students, supporting them through challenging research projects at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and machine learning.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Research Topics Supported:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real-Time Construction Object Detection:</strong> Developing efficient deep learning models for detecting construction materials and hazards in dynamic environments.</li>
<li><strong>Imitation Learning Deployment:</strong> Bridging the sim-to-real gap by deploying learned policies from simulation onto physical robotic platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Human Motion Understanding (Ongoing):</strong> Analyzing human body kinematics and intent prediction for safe human-robot collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<!-- <p>
These projects emphasize rigorous experimentation, reproducible research practices, and the translation of theoretical concepts into working systems.

## DESSAIM — Art Meets Swarm Robotics
<div class="row align-items-center">
<div class="col-md-7">
<p>
<strong>Where technology meets humanity.</strong> While robots excel at precision and efficiency, art infuses them with soul. The <em>DESSAIM</em> project explores this intersection, investigating how swarm robotics can become a medium for artistic expression.
</p>
<p>
Working closely with professional artists and choreographers, the team develops emergent behaviors that transform robot swarms into living canvases. The robots respond to music, human presence, and each other — creating performances that blur the line between machine and art.
</p>
<p>
<strong>My Contribution:</strong> I worked on the operation of the mobile robots during performances, ensuring reliable swarm coordination and real-time responsiveness during live events.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Impact:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Contributed to <strong>public art performances</strong> reaching diverse audiences — from tech enthusiasts to art lovers with no robotics background.</li>
<li>The project demonstrates that robots can evoke emotional responses and foster connection between technology and humanity.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I was part of the organizing team for the <strong>Robot and Art Workshop</strong> at <em>IEEE ICRA 2024</em>, which brought together researchers, artists, and industry practitioners to explore the creative potential of robotics.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Workshop Highlights:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Keynote talks from leading figures in robotic art and computational creativity.</li>
<li>Live demonstrations of swarm choreography and interactive installations.</li>
<!-- <li>Panel discussions on the future of human-robot artistic collaboration.</li> -->
<li>Hands-on sessions where participants programmed robots for artistic motion.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<!-- The workshop attracted a diverse audience and sparked conversations about how robotics research can contribute to culture and society beyond traditional engineering metrics. It was a rewarding experience to be part of this initiative. -->

## Motion Composition Workshops
<div class="row align-items-center">
<div class="col-md-7">
<p>
Building on the success of the ICRA workshop, the team launched a series of <strong>Motion Composition Workshops</strong> designed to engage the general public with robotic systems in a creative and accessible way. I contributed to developing and facilitating these sessions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Workshop Format:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Participants — with no prior robotics experience — learn to control a <em>robotic arm</em> through intuitive interfaces.</li>
<li>They compose artistic trajectories, creating visual patterns and motion sculptures.</li>
<li>Sessions conclude with collaborative performances where multiple participants coordinate their compositions.</li>
</ul>
<!-- <p>
These workshops demonstrate that robotics is not just for engineers — it's a tool for creativity that anyone can wield. By lowering the barrier to entry, they inspire new perspectives on what robots can be.

## Engaging the Next Generation
<div class="row align-items-center">
<div class="col-md-5">
{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/kids.png" title="STEM Outreach" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
<div class="col-md-7">
<p>
Inspiring young minds is one of the most rewarding aspects of this work. I participate in our lab's <strong>outreach programs</strong>, helping with school visits and interactive workshops for students of all ages.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Outreach Activities:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lab Tours:</strong> Guided tours where students see research robots in action — from drones to mobile platforms to manipulators.</li>
<li><strong>Hands-On Workshops:</strong> Age-appropriate activities where kids program simple behaviors, understanding cause-and-effect in robotics.</li>
<li><strong>Q&A Sessions:</strong> Open discussions about careers in robotics, encouraging curiosity and demystifying the path to becoming a roboticist.</li>
</ul>
<!-- <p>
By engaging the younger generation early, these programs plant seeds of curiosity that may one day grow into groundbreaking research. Seeing a child's eyes light up when a robot responds to their command is a reminder of why this work matters.
