Remote sensing of spectral reflectance is a core tool in precision agriculture: visible and near-infrared signals are routinely used to infer plant health, stress, and canopy properties. However, plants and pollinators also interact through the near-ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, and UV reflectance in crop flowers is still under-documented compared to non-crop species.

This work provides (1) a structured literature review of UV reflectance studies in crops and (2) new measurements on strawberry cultivars. We analyze how prior work measures reflectance (instrumentation and spectral ranges), which crop families are represented, and where the biggest gaps remain for in-situ (field) sensing. We also use a pollinator-vision analysis model to translate spectra into visibility/contrast trends that are meaningful for insect perception.

Key contributions and takeaways:

- A literature review of crop UV reflectance, highlighting methodological trends and under-studied crop species.
- Evidence that much of the existing work is lab-based and spans broad spectral ranges (near-UV through IR).
- New spectral comparisons of white-flowering strawberry cultivars, revealing pollinator-relevant differences in near-UV and blue ranges.
- AI-driven analysis using a pollinator-vision model to quantify contrast/visibility across cultivars.
- Practical motivation for incorporating UV reflectance into crop breeding and pollinator-aware management.
