DESSAIM is an interdisciplinary robotics + performing arts project where three swarms—tabletop micro-robots, collision-safe indoor flyers, and human-scale mobile manipulators—perform choreographed, emergent behaviors in close proximity to an audience. The goal is to give artists a reliable “swarm instrument”: a shared programming and control workflow that lets the same behavior logic run across very different platforms while remaining expressive, repeatable, and safe.

Bringing swarms into real performance venues turns aesthetics into hard engineering: robots must coordinate at high rate, stay localized without bulky motion-capture infrastructure, and remain robust to changing lighting, occlusions, and people moving through the stage. Our work centers on scalable communication for synchronization and situated interaction, and on practical global positioning (e.g., a lightweight UWB anchor setup plus filtering) to keep behaviors stable across installations; the project culminated in repeated public performances and received the Best Video Award at ICRA 2025.
